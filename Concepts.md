PPHL:
talk to someone else, or leave a message with your problem and we'll try to get someone else to handle it in time.
steps:
1. call in
    a. callback (within 1 day guaranteed)
        I. check on your PPHL call.
            1. dial number, get recorded response or Winnie's "just breakup"
    a. ring a random other phone at flipside
        I. if someone answers, great! hangup
        II. if no one answers the phone, give option to answer another person's PPHL call (timeout of 1 day/space concerns which gives Winnie's "just breakup" as the default)
            1. once you answer someone else's PPHL call, you record your own PPHL call and get a number which you can type in to get your results in 1 day
2. hangup
